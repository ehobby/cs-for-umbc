        <p>I'm Emily. I graduated from UMBC in 2020 as a CS major and creative writing minor. I started at Microsoft
            right
            after graduation and have been there ever since! This is my guide for other CS students who want to get the
            most
            out of their college career. If you're here for general advice, take a look at my timeline guide. If your
            looking for specific job application, interview, or internship advice, I have guides for those as well!
            Theres
            also a section with downloadable templates for keeping track of applications, planning out large projects,
            and
            planning out your classes for your four years at UMBC</p>
        <br>
        <p>If you're not a UMBC student, feel free to use the guide! A lot of the class-specific information won't be as
            applicable to you, but the career advice will still work.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Good luck, and if you have any questions or suggestions, check the <a href="./me.html">About Me</a> page for
            more
            information and my email!</p>
