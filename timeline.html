        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>September</h3>
        <p>Your first semester in college! A big and exciting step. This semester is all about creating a foundation for good habits and setting the trajectory of your college career. You should be taking 201, the very first computer science class, along with a math class, possibly a language, and another general education. Let the math and 201 be your only technical classes this semester, then load up on easy credits (including English 100 if you didn’t complete that in high school). This will let you keep the momentum from high school. You have the stamina to sit in 4-6 hours of classes a day that you won’t have by your senior year. It will also get you ahead in numbers of credits. This number determines when you’ll be able to register for classes. As a freshman, you’ll have the fewest number of classes of anyone at UMBC. Your goal isn’t to have more credits than everyone, your goal is to have more credits than the rest of the freshmen. Upperclassmen won’t be taking freshman courses, so you’ll still be able to sign up for the classes you need.
            The two most important events are involvementfest (usually the second week of school) and the career fair (usually the end of September). Going to both of these events prepared is incredibly important. Involvementfest is the student org showcase. You get to walk around and see which ones you want to join. I recommend at least one. It will help develop your network, get you in contact with upperclassmen, and give you a fun outlet. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be a professional student org. I was part of musical theater club, garden club, and Bartleby, none of which relate to computer science.
            The career fair is your second big event. This happens every semester in the RAC, although the fall fair is bigger than the spring. It is a key time to practice talking to employers and getting connections, aka business cards. If you’re worried that you don’t have any experience, don’t be! Employers that are open to hiring freshmen are marked as ‘freshmen friendly’ at the fair. To prepare, put together a rough resume and visit the career center by mid-september. They will help you clean it up and prepare for the fair.
            </p>
        
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the career center and get your resume reviewed before the career fair</li>
            <li>Join one student organization</li>
            <li>Go to the career fair and talk to 10 different companies</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>October</h3>
            <p>This will be your first round of midterms. 201 and most math classes actually have three exams, meaning you’ll have one in mid-October, then mid-November, then a final during finals week. Study for these exams. They are usually worth 5-10 times the number of points as the homework you’ve had so far, so treat them that way. If you usually take 3 hours to do homework, spend 15-30 hours studying for the exam. You won’t regret it. The better you do in the first half of the semester, the less stress you’ll have in the second half.
            Once you finish your 201 midterm, take it to your professor’s office hours. Sit down and go through what you got wrong and why you got it wrong, even if it is obvious. Show them you care about learning and want to get it right. This professor is going to be a key reference for you when applying for summer experiences, so you need them to like you and believe in your work ethic. By the end of October, your 201 professor should know you by name.
            Next, it’s time to start thinking about next semester. I know it seems early, but trust me you want to be ahead of the curve. Registering for classes as a current student is much more self-directed than when you went through orientation. The class schedule will be released by the third week in October, and you need to be ready. As soon as it is released, see which classes they are offering when, and with which professors. Refer to my recommended course plan and make a list of four classes you want to take, as well as three alternates. Then go visit a COEIT advisor. They are located on the second floor of ITE.
            In this advising appointment, you need your advisor to give you permission to sign up for classes. If you don’t, you will not be able to sign up on time. You need to sign up as soon as possible. Sign up dates and times are based on the number of credits you’ve completed, so you’ll be signing up late as it is. Get there early, get approved, have those classes sitting in your shopping cart, and hit enroll the minute you’re allowed to.</p>
        
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish your midterms strong</li>
            <li>Plan out classes for next semester</li>
            <li>Visit the COEIT advisors</li>
            <li>Develop a relationship with your 201 professor (they should know you by name)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>November</h3>
        <p>You’re halfway done your first semester now and things are starting to move fast. Your first computer science project ever will be due soon and you need to start thinking about summer internships. But let’s take this one step at a time.
            Your first 201 project might feel a little rough. It’s a bigger problem than you’ve ever been given to solve, and you feel like you don’t have the skills to do it. Most important, break down the problems into smaller and smaller ones until you feel like you can handle the smallest chunks. Then write one chunk and test the crap out of it. Write another, test it, then put the two together and test them. Wash and repeat until you are finished. Don’t be afraid to go to TA office hours, but go when you’re absolutely stuck on a definable problem, not when you’re just starting out and want someone to tell you what to do.
            Next, prepare to apply for summer positions. Take those contacts you got at the career fair and research them. Find open industry positions that take freshmen, but don’t limit your search. My favorite summer experience for freshmen are REUs. There are literally hundreds. Each one pays $5,500 for the summer as well as paying for your lodging. You get to work on a research project that is interesting and present at the end of the summer. The best part is the application. Most only require a resume and personal statement. This is great news for freshmen because, at this point, you are not prepared for technical interviews. Look at this guide for writing personal statements, then visit the career center one more time to get your outline reviewed. Put together a list of 15 experiences you will be applying for and reach out to references (if required) and ask them to write you a letter of recommendation. One of these should be your 201 professor.
            Finally, the last half of this month will be your second round of midterms and Thanksgiving break. Work hard just as you did on the first round and tweak your strategy if it didn’t work out as well as you would like. Study groups are great, but anything more than four people tend to turn into a party. Keep your motivation up and relax hard over the break.
            </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish your first project</li>
            <li>Make a list of 15 summer experiences you will be applying for</li>
            <li>Write a cover letter and personal statement</li>
            <li>Visit the career center to review your cover letter and personal statement</li>
            <li>Ask for letters of recommendation</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>December</h3>
        <p>Only half of this month will be spent at school. These last couple of weeks are all about academics to ensure the highest GPA possible. Blackboard won’t calculate your grades accurately, so check the syllabus and make your own spreadsheet grade calculator, you can see an example in the downloads page. Figure out current grades and grades you need on the final projects and exams to get the final grades you want. Prioritize based on that. Put 201 first unless it is a shoo-in for an A or you’re in danger of failing another class.
            Take care of yourself, make a final schedule (again see an example in the downloads), and stick with it. You’ll do great and be able to spend the second half of December relaxing in style.
            </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish 201 with an A</li>
            <li>Get at least a 3.5 for the semester</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>January</h3>
        <p>I know it’s kind of cheating to have things to do over break, but your first break home from college will feel super long compared to high school, so I think it’s fair. Besides, you only have one task, and that is apply to all the REUs you’ve been prepping for all semester! By this point, you have the personal statements, resume, and letters of recommendation. All you have to do is put it together and fill out applications. Aim to do around 3-4 a week and you should be done before you get back to school! Then watch those acceptances roll in.</p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply to all the REUs</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>February</h3>
        <p>This semester, you should be taking 202 and 203. 202 is much more project focus than 201, so you need to keep that in mind. Usually 5 projects over the course of the semester, and they all take the same amount of effort if not more so than your 201 work. Plan ahead, give yourself plenty of time to debug, and you should be alright. Also really learn pointers. You’re going to need them.
            The rest of your classes should be math and general education. Calc 2 usually sucks but it is the last calc you’ll have to take, so appreciate that. Stay on top of everything this semester, students usually see a drop off in GPA because they assume they have everything under control. Don’t get complacent.
            Finally, finish up any last applications for the summer and follow through on your letters of recommendation. Make sure your professors sent them where they were supposed to be sent.
            </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain the same level of commitment to your classes</li>
            <li>Keep attending your club meetings and building your network</li>
            <li>Finish REU applications not open in January</li>
            <li>Follow up on your letters of recommendation</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>March</h3>
        <p>March should be your first round of midterms, just before spring break. You know the drill by now. Start studying at least a week in advance and have specific topics for each day. Then the day before, complete one big final review. You got this.
            By this point, your REUs should start notifying you about your acceptance status. You’re not going to get all of them. In fact, you’re not going to get most of them. Understand that there are a million factors that you cannot control, and not being accepted is not the worst thing in the world. Stay focused on your school work and use spring break to evaluate your position. If you’ve heard back from a majority of the programs and haven’t been accepted, start looking for local internships in the Baltimore area. Use UMBCworks and apply for as many as possible.
            If you have gotten accepted into one or more, congratulations! You now need to start thinking about which one you want more. Think about location (it’s more important than you think), prestige (it’s less important than you think), and project (it’s about as important as you think). This is your first chance to specialize in something. Make it something you’re interested in.
            Finally, enjoy your spring break and get ready for the second half of the semester. Organize your due dates and get ready for some tougher projects in 202.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare well for midterms</li>
            <li>Pick an REU to accept/apply for local internships</li>
            <li>Organize the second half of your semester over spring break</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>April</h3>
        <p>This April is all about school and clubs. You’ve done all you can do regarding summer experience, so it’s time to try and put those worries aside and focus on an academically successful term. Study, spend time on projects, and set aside time for friends. Your mental health will suffer if you sit in your dorm room all the time. Try to enjoy the nicer weather and consider exercising a bit more. Can’t hurt, right?</p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Take care of your mental health</li>
            <li>Forget about summer experiences (for now)</li>
            <li>Aim for a 4.0</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>May</h3>
        <p>Your last few weeks! Don’t worry about any internship stuff, just focus on getting your final 202 project done and studying for your exams. Make a spreadsheet calculating your current grades (blackboard is unreliable) and figure out which classes are on the bubble. Put your effort towards those, just like last semester. Maximize your effectiveness and you’ll do well.
            After finals are over, you’ll most likely not have much time between your move out date and the start of your summer work. Pack up your dorm accordingly. Do laundry on campus and pack clean clothes you need for the summer in a separate suitcase. Dump the rest of your stuff at your parents, spend a weekend sleeping and eating, then travel to your new home for the next few months! Congratulations, you made it through your first year. Check out <a href="./job.html">my internship guide</a> for more information.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish freshman year strong</li>
            <li>Pack and get ready for your internship!</li>

        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Fall Semester</h3>
        <p>
            This semester, you need to do three things: decide the category of summer experience you want, put a lot of energy into 341, and decide on a minor. I’ll go through them one by one, but that is the basics.
First, summer experiences. If you really loved your research position, begin thinking about the possibility of working in research and going to grad school. If you want to try out industry, there are a few other choices to make. Most likely, you are now qualified for a position at a smaller, local company. However, you can stretch and try for one of the big names. Those companies tend to have early deadlines (you’ll be interviewing in October/November) versus smaller companies (March-ish). Either way, visit the career center. Update your resume with your summer work and make a list of 15 companies you want to apply to. Keep track of their deadlines and reach out to any UMBC alumni who currently work there.
Next, focus on 341. It’s a tough class. Don’t try to just get through it, try to really learn what they’re trying to teach you. This class is basically technical interviewing 101. Lock down these basics, practice them, and retain them like your future depends on it. The class will be easier and you’ll be more prepared for next year when you have to start seriously interviewing.
Finally, you should decide on a minor. Math is popular, you only have to take a few extra classes, but I chose creative writing. Knowing how to communicate your ideas on paper is undervalued. Whatever you choose, plan to take a class towards it next semester. It should be something you like, bonus points if it gives you an area of expertise most computer scientists don’t have.
On the topic of class scheduling, get on top of that early. You should get into assembly for your spring semester as well as at least one other upper level computer science course. You don’t want to leave them all till the end.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Make a linkedin</li>
            <li>Decide what you want to do for the summer</li>
            <li>Really learn 341</li>
            <li>Pick up a minor</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Spring Semester</h3>
        <p>
            This semester, your focus should be on your first 400 level class, locking down your summer position, and getting a job on campus. Also keep an eye out for the sophomore slump.Your GPA should not go below 3.5.
On campus jobs won’t pay much, but they give you a professional skill set you won’t learn in your classes, more concrete experience on your resume, and references you can use for future applications. Try and get a job related to computer science, whether that be as a research assistant, division of information technology, or even the career center. Work 10 hours a week and practice your professional communication and work ethic.
Off campus jobs may be tempting (and pay more), but they will not work around a student’s schedule. If you take this route, be up front with your manager. Ask for time off before finals and make sure it’s ok to do homework on the job.
Next, accept your summer position. This may be the first time you have to complete technical interviews (check out my technical interview guide). Practice, stay calm, and if you fail, just think of it as practice. No one is born knowing how to whiteboard. The more you practice now, the better you’ll be when it really counts.
Prepare for that position by brushing up on the language you’ll be working in and researching the company. Many have their code bases available. The more research you do, the faster you’ll be able to start meaningful work this summer.
When signing up for classes for next semester, try and get into algorithms. It’ll help you in the long run and make your senior year much easier. Finally, begin the technical interview prep guide. The topics under the algorithm section will be completely new to you, but hopefully you’ll be taking algorithms in the fall and be ready for internship interviews by October. Do what you can and find a friend to study with!
        </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Accept a summer position</li>
            <li>Maintain a GPA of at least 3.5</li>
            <li>Get an on-campus job</li>
            <li>Start the interview prep guide</li>

        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Fall Semester</h3>
        <p>
            This semester is your second most important career-wise. The summer between your junior and senior year is your most important internship, so you want to get a big name company. Think Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, etc. Apply early and complete interviews as soon as possible. There are a finite number of spots and they fill on a rolling basis. Check out the interview and application guide, start preparing in August, and be ready. At this point, if you would like to intern at Microsoft, reach out to me at hobbyemily@gmail.com. Include “Microsoft Referral” in the subject line. I will respond within 48 hours and talk you through the process. FYI, this process should start as early as possible. Spots fill quickly.
Keep working at your on campus job, practicing setting professional goals and taking steps to reach them. Put most of your school effort into your OS/algo class and relax with classes from your minor. Stay up to date on your extra curriculars and linkedin to keep your network expanding. You’ve laid down a good foundation for school work and internships. Keep it up so that next year, you’ll be ready for your full time job applications. Try to go to three different career center events, either knowledge sessions, interviews, career fair, or anything else that informs you about the work culture of different companies.
Side note, if you are taking algo, pay attention the same way you paid attention in 341. This class is interview 102. Retain the information and your life will be much easier when preparing for full time technical interviews.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply for the big name internships</li>
            <li>Apply for 15 smaller internships</li>
            <li>Keep your GPA high (try for only 1 B)</li>
            <li>Grow your professional network by going to 3 career center events</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Spring Semester</h3>
        <p>
            This semester is when you really get to start seeing the effects of your hard work. Hopefully you’ve been able to front load a lot of your classes so you can choose to take 12-15 credits. You’ve locked down an impressive internship, and you don’t have much else to worry about. This semester is about preparing to impress in that internship (check out my guide) and enjoying your college experience. Consider doing an interesting side project or getting more involved in your student orgs!
Finally, start to think of this semester as your ramp up to your full time job search which will begin in the fall. Update your linkedin and reach out to contacts, attend career center events, and begin practicing for technical interviews. It would also be helpful to develop a list of companies you’d like to work for now instead of having to worry about it during your internship this summer. Include the company you’re interning for, other major companies, and local companies.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain high grades in upper level classes (1 B max)</li>
            <li>Work on a side project</li>
            <li>Spend time networking in preparation for the fulltime job search</li>
            <li>Practice technical interviewing</li>
            <li>Build a list of at least 25 companies you’d like to work for</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2 id="senior">Senior</h2>
        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <p>
            
        </p>
        <h3>Fall Semester</h3>
        <p>
            This semester is the final hurdle. Take only 12 credits, you’ll need the other time for the job search. Keep your academics up to date, but worry less about grades than you have for the previous semesters. This semester is all about finding a fulltime job for after graduation.
First, consider the company you interned at. You should know whether or not you have a return offer (unless you interned for Google, their conversion process takes longer). If you enjoyed the work and want to accept, apply for at least 2 or 3 other big name companies early. This will give you leverage when negotiating your salary.
If you did not like your work or did not get a return offer, your job is now to apply for jobs. Try and finish at least 5 applications a week and do one technical interview question a day. You should be a pro at interviews by this point. Again, if you would like a referral to Microsoft, email me by October 1. 
Your hard work should pay off. If you have good grades and keep a cool head, you should have an offer letter signed before the end of the semester. Look at my offer guide for information on negotiation and deadlines. Tl;dr don’t take the first one you get if you don’t love it. Stretch out the deadline until you hear back from as many as possible so you can make the best decision for you and your career goals.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Get at least 2 offers</li>
            <li>Pick your new job</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Spring Semester</h3>
        <p>
            Now you can really relax. You have a signed offer letter and should have only a few classes left to take. Enjoy your last semester. Take time and don’t feel guilty for slacking off just a bit (but definitely graduation on time). If you feel like doing another personal project, go for it. Once you start working for a company, anything you do on company time, they own. This is your time to build a project that could generate some income without corporate swooping in and taking your code.
The only other thing you need to consider is any preparation work needed to start your job. Most training will be done once you get there, but it can’t hurt to practice a language, research corporate culture, or go visit a new city (if you’re moving away from the Baltimore area). Devote some time to make your transition into the professional world as smooth as possible.
        </p>
