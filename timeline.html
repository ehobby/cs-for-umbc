        <h2>Freshman</h2>
        <h3>September</h3>
        <p>Your first semester in college! A big and exciting step. This semester is all about creating a foundation for good habits and setting the trajectory of your college career. You should be taking 201, the very first computer science class, along with a math class, possibly a language, and another general education. Let the math and 201 be your only technical classes this semester, then load up on easy credits (including English 100 if you didn’t complete that in high school). This will let you keep the momentum from high school. You have the stamina to sit in 4-6 hours of classes a day that you won’t have by your senior year. It will also get you ahead in numbers of credits. This number determines when you’ll be able to register for classes. As a freshman, you’ll have the fewest number of classes of anyone at UMBC. Your goal isn’t to have more credits than everyone, your goal is to have more credits than the rest of the freshmen. Upperclassmen won’t be taking freshman courses, so you’ll still be able to sign up for the classes you need.
            The two most important events are involvementfest (usually the second week of school) and the career fair (usually the end of September). Going to both of these events prepared is incredibly important. Involvementfest is the student org showcase. You get to walk around and see which ones you want to join. I recommend at least one. It will help develop your network, get you in contact with upperclassmen, and give you a fun outlet. Keep in mind this doesn’t need to be a professional student org. I was part of musical theater club, garden club, and Bartleby, none of which relate to computer science.
            The career fair is your second big event. This happens every semester in the RAC, although the fall fair is bigger than the spring. It is a key time to practice talking to employers and getting connections, aka business cards. If you’re worried that you don’t have any experience, don’t be! Employers that are open to hiring freshmen are marked as ‘freshmen friendly’ at the fair. To prepare, put together a rough resume and visit the career center by mid-september. They will help you clean it up and prepare for the fair.
            </p>
        
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the career center and get your resume reviewed before the career fair</li>
            <li>Join one student organization</li>
            <li>Go to the career fair and talk to 10 different companies</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>October</h3>
            <p>This will be your first round of midterms. 201 and most math classes actually have three exams, meaning you’ll have one in mid-October, then mid-November, then a final during finals week. Study for these exams. They are usually worth 5-10 times the number of points as the homework you’ve had so far, so treat them that way. If you usually take 3 hours to do homework, spend 15-30 hours studying for the exam. You won’t regret it. The better you do in the first half of the semester, the less stress you’ll have in the second half.
            Once you finish your 201 midterm, take it to your professor’s office hours. Sit down and go through what you got wrong and why you got it wrong, even if it is obvious. Show them you care about learning and want to get it right. This professor is going to be a key reference for you when applying for summer experiences, so you need them to like you and believe in your work ethic. By the end of October, your 201 professor should know you by name.
            Next, it’s time to start thinking about next semester. I know it seems early, but trust me you want to be ahead of the curve. Registering for classes as a current student is much more self-directed than when you went through orientation. The class schedule will be released by the third week in October, and you need to be ready. As soon as it is released, see which classes they are offering when, and with which professors. Refer to my recommended course plan and make a list of four classes you want to take, as well as three alternates. Then go visit a COEIT advisor. They are located on the second floor of ITE.
            In this advising appointment, you need your advisor to give you permission to sign up for classes. If you don’t, you will not be able to sign up on time. You need to sign up as soon as possible. Sign up dates and times are based on the number of credits you’ve completed, so you’ll be signing up late as it is. Get there early, get approved, have those classes sitting in your shopping cart, and hit enroll the minute you’re allowed to.</p>
        
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish your midterms strong</li>
            <li>Plan out classes for next semester</li>
            <li>Visit the COEIT advisors</li>
            <li>Develop a relationship with your 201 professor (they should know you by name)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>November</h3>
        <p>You’re halfway done your first semester now and things are starting to move fast. Your first computer science project ever will be due soon and you need to start thinking about summer internships. But let’s take this one step at a time.
            Your first 201 project might feel a little rough. It’s a bigger problem than you’ve ever been given to solve, and you feel like you don’t have the skills to do it. Most important, break down the problems into smaller and smaller ones until you feel like you can handle the smallest chunks. Then write one chunk and test the crap out of it. Write another, test it, then put the two together and test them. Wash and repeat until you are finished. Don’t be afraid to go to TA office hours, but go when you’re absolutely stuck on a definable problem, not when you’re just starting out and want someone to tell you what to do.
            Next, prepare to apply for summer positions. Take those contacts you got at the career fair and research them. Find open industry positions that take freshmen, but don’t limit your search. My favorite summer experience for freshmen are REUs. There are literally hundreds. Each one pays $5,500 for the summer as well as paying for your lodging. You get to work on a research project that is interesting and present at the end of the summer. The best part is the application. Most only require a resume and personal statement. This is great news for freshmen because, at this point, you are not prepared for technical interviews. Look at this guide for writing personal statements, then visit the career center one more time to get your outline reviewed. Put together a list of 15 experiences you will be applying for and reach out to references (if required) and ask them to write you a letter of recommendation. One of these should be your 201 professor.
            Finally, the last half of this month will be your second round of midterms and Thanksgiving break. Work hard just as you did on the first round and tweak your strategy if it didn’t work out as well as you would like. Study groups are great, but anything more than four people tend to turn into a party. Keep your motivation up and relax hard over the break.
            </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish your first project</li>
            <li>Make a list of 15 summer experiences you will be applying for</li>
            <li>Write a cover letter and personal statement</li>
            <li>Visit the career center to review your cover letter and personal statement</li>
            <li>Ask for letters of recommendation</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>December</h3>
        <p>Only half of this month will be spent at school. These last couple of weeks are all about academics to ensure the highest GPA possible. Blackboard won’t calculate your grades accurately, so check the syllabus and make your own spreadsheet grade calculator, you can see an example in the downloads page. Figure out current grades and grades you need on the final projects and exams to get the final grades you want. Prioritize based on that. Put 201 first unless it is a shoo-in for an A or you’re in danger of failing another class.
            Take care of yourself, make a final schedule (again see an example in the downloads), and stick with it. You’ll do great and be able to spend the second half of December relaxing in style.
            </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Finish 201 with an A</li>
            <li>Get at least a 3.5 for the semester</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>January</h3>
        <p>I know it’s kind of cheating to have things to do over break, but your first break home from college will feel super long compared to high school, so I think it’s fair. Besides, you only have one task, and that is apply to all the REUs you’ve been prepping for all semester! By this point, you have the personal statements, resume, and letters of recommendation. All you have to do is put it together and fill out applications. Aim to do around 3-4 a week and you should be done before you get back to school! Then watch those acceptances roll in.</p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply to all the REUs</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>February</h3>
        <p>This semester, you should be taking 202 and 203. 202 is much more project focus than 201, so you need to keep that in mind. Usually 5 projects over the course of the semester, and they all take the same amount of effort if not more so than your 201 work. Plan ahead, give yourself plenty of time to debug, and you should be alright. Also really learn pointers. You’re going to need them.
            The rest of your classes should be math and general education. Calc 2 usually sucks but it is the last calc you’ll have to take, so appreciate that. Stay on top of everything this semester, students usually see a drop off in GPA because they assume they have everything under control. Don’t get complacent.
            Finally, finish up any last applications for the summer and follow through on your letters of recommendation. Make sure your professors sent them where they were supposed to be sent.
            </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintain the same level of commitment to your classes</li>
            <li>Keep attending your club meetings and building your network</li>
            <li>Finish REU applications not open in January</li>
            <li>Follow up on your letters of recommendation</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>March</h3>
        <p>March should be your first round of midterms, just before spring break. You know the drill by now. Start studying at least a week in advance and have specific topics for each day. Then the day before, complete one big final review. You got this.
            By this point, your REUs should start notifying you about your acceptance status. You’re not going to get all of them. In fact, you’re not going to get most of them. Understand that there are a million factors that you cannot control, and not being accepted is not the worst thing in the world. Stay focused on your school work and use spring break to evaluate your position. If you’ve heard back from a majority of the programs and haven’t been accepted, start looking for local internships in the Baltimore area. Use UMBCworks and apply for as many as possible.
            If you have gotten accepted into one or more, congratulations! You now need to start thinking about which one you want more. Think about location (it’s more important than you think), prestige (it’s less important than you think), and project (it’s about as important as you think). This is your first chance to specialize in something. Make it something you’re interested in.
            Finally, enjoy your spring break and get ready for the second half of the semester. Organize your due dates and get ready for some tougher projects in 202.
        </p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Prepare well for midterms</li>
            <li>Pick an REU to accept/apply for local internships</li>
            <li>Organize the second half of your semester over spring break</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>April</h3>
        <p>This April is all about school and clubs. You’ve done all you can do regarding summer experience, so it’s time to try and put those worries aside and focus on an academically successful term. Study, spend time on projects, and set aside time for friends. Your mental health will suffer if you sit in your dorm room all the time. Try to enjoy the nicer weather and consider exercising a bit more. Can’t hurt, right?</p>
        <h4>Goals:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Take care of your mental health</li>
            <li>Forget about summer experiences (for now)</li>
            <li>Aim for a 4.0</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>May</h3>
        <p>Your last few weeks! Don’t worry about any internship stuff, just focus on getting your final 202 project done and studying for your exams. Make a spreadsheet calculating your current grades (blackboard is unreliable) and figure out which classes are on the bubble. Put your effort towards those, just like last semester. Maximize your effectiveness and you’ll do well.
            After finals are over, you’ll most likely not have much time between your move out date and the start of your summer work. Pack up your dorm accordingly. Do laundry on campus and pack clean clothes you need for the summer in a separate suitcase. Dump the rest of your stuff at your parents, spend a weekend sleeping and eating, then travel to your new home for the next few months! Congratulations, you made it through your first year.
