        <p>I'm Emily. I graduated UMBC class of 2020 with a degree in computer science and a minor in creative writing.
            During my four years there, I interned at NIST and Google, worked for the career center and as a TA, and
            conducted my own research.
            After graduation, I started a job at Microsoft, where I work now! I'm currently on the devices and drivers
            team,
            meaning I work with low level hardware-software interactions. Some of my other work interests include
            web-based
            virtual reality and machine learning for code generation.

            I started this website because I wanted to leave behind a blueprint for CS majors at UMBC who want to
            compete in
            the big leagues. We're not the most prestegious name in computer science, but the program can prepare you
            for a
            stellar career if you put in the time and effort.
