        <h1>Applying for Jobs</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            You’ve already put in the technical work. You’re doing well in school and have been following the interview prep guide (go check it out if you haven’t already). This stage is completely non-technical and all psychological. While you’re doing this, of course, you’ll have to also be following the interview guide and preparing technically. This section focuses on all the business strategies you need to compliment your technical work and get a job you love.
        </p>
        <h2>August - Research Stage</h2>
        <p>
            At this point, it's a numbers game. It’s really similar to applying for colleges, but you don’t have to pay application fees. Spend the first two weeks researching companies and making a list of the ones you’d like to work for. These should be divided into three categories: stretch, reasonable, and safe. Your stretch jobs should be the big corporations (if that’s what you want to do). Dream jobs that a lot of people want but few people get. Reasonable jobs should be jobs you’re fairly confident you can get and would be happy doing. Safe jobs are jobs you feel you could definitely lock down. Have around 20 in each category. Use UMBCworks for local jobs and Linkedin jobs to search nationwide. Put all these jobs in a spreadsheet that tracks when the deadline is, when you last had contact with them, and the names of any contacts you made.
        </p>
        <h2>September - Application Stage</h2>
        <p>
            As school is starting up and homework has not kicked off yet, start your applications. This means having an up-to-date resume and transcripts. Apply for 10-15 jobs per week, tailoring each resume to each job. It’s a lot of work, each application will likely take around an hour. That’s an extra two hours of work per day without any positive feedback. In fact, the only feedback you’re initially going to receive is rejections. And that’s ok. Just keep chugging and get it done.
        </p>
        <h2>October - Interview Stage</h2>
        <p>
            Try and schedule all your on site interviews for October and early November. Most likely each job will have a few rounds of interviews. The typical interview process for larger companies: initial application, virtual technical challenge, phone interview, on site interview. It’s exhausting and stressful but the more you do the better you’ll get at them. Keep your head down and work, and try not to fail your midterms along the way.   
        </p>
        <h2>November - Offers and Negotiation Stage</h2>
        <p>
            You should get offers in before Thanksgiving break. The key here is to time your offers so they overlap before deadlines expire, so you can use them as negotiation. Evaluate based on location, compensation, benefits, work, and corporate culture, then work on negotiating. Use tools like glassdoor and salary.com to figure out how much you’re worth. You can negotiate salaries, paid time off, and bonuses. Check out the career center resources for negotiation information. After you’ve negotiated and the best offer has risen to the top, accept it! You’re done.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            If you don’t get any offers, it’s ok. Repeat this process starting in December but focusing on more local jobs, including more government contracting. Rest, regroup, and be ready to hit the ground running. Accept your offer and get excited for graduation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now relax for the first time in four years!
