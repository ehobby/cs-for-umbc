        <h1>Technical Interview Preparation</h1>
        <h2>Six Months Before Interviews</h2>
        <p>At this point, you don’t know the companies you’re going to be interviewing with. If you are applying for competitive internships or full-time positions, start this step in March, so you’ll be ready for your interviews around September or November. For the next three months, practice the basics of data structures and algorithms that will be the foundation for all technical interviews, as well as decide the language you want to interview in (I suggest python). These will cover about 60-70% of the interview questions. The rest can be more logical and straightforward. If you have been excelling in your classes, you should be ok.
            Read Cracking the Coding Interview. It’ll go over most of the list here as well as interviewing strategies. Take notes and look at the 7 steps she suggests you follow in a technical interview. Memorize them.
            The one thing the book will not help you with is figuring out which method to use for which problem. This only comes with practice.

        <h2>Three Months Before Interviews</h2>
        <p>
            After you’ve finished reading and studying, make an account on leetcode. Many people use hackerrank, but I find leetcode has a broader, tougher question base. Do one problem on paper at least every other day. Have a notebook full of handwritten code. When you think you’re close to an answer, type it in and fine-tune. Don’t give up on questions and try not to look at other users’ solutions until you have one of your own. Focus on getting a correct solution first then making it more efficient. This goes for real interviews as well. Practicing following the 7 stages of technical interviewing you read about in Cracking the Coding Interview.
            Next, find a friend who is also getting ready to interview. Meet up once a week somewhere with a whiteboard. You each take a turn being the interviewer and interviewee. Practice whiteboarding questions, critiquing each other on your communication skills as well as problem-solving skills. Come prepared with one question to ask your friend (that you know how to solve) and get to work. This can also be done by yourself. If you are practicing alone, be sure to still talk aloud through your solving process, even if you feel a little silly.
            At this point, you should still be solving questions of all types. Don’t zero in on things you’re really good at, and don’t get discouraged by only doing things you’re not as strong in (for me this is graphs. I hate them).
        </p>
        <h2>One Month Before Interviews</h2>
        <p>
            Now is the time you start honing in on the things you’re not as strong in. Re-learn the theory and practice recognizing those types of problems, then try and solve them. Figuring out which data structure and algorithm work best for each question is half the battle. Learning to implement things efficiently is memorization, picking the correct thing to implement is the hard part. Spend two weeks practicing them every day, and even if you don’t hit each question out of the park, you should be able to string together coherent thoughts.
            You should now also know when and with who your interviews are. Spend some time researching those companies. New products they’ve launched and their success and failures, as well as the fundamental technologies they use to build their products. It’s useful in an interview to be able to give an exact reason as to why you’re interested in a company, even if they don’t ask about details. Be ready to show how prepared you are. Brainstorm ~3 specific questions to ask about day to day life as a software engineer at that company.
        </p>
        <h2>Two Weeks Before Interviews</h2>
        <p>
            Take some time to prepare the more human side of your interview. Besides whiteboarding questions, many interviewers will ask you about projects on your resume and work experience you’ve had. Use The acronym STAR: Situation, Task, Action, Result, and come up with 3-5 examples of times you worked hard, either by yourself or in a group, and got something done. Write them down, remember them, and use them in your interview.
        </p>
        <h2>One Week Before Interviews</h2>
        <p>
            Review your notes on the company, technical interview topics, and stories. Try not to psych yourself out. You’ve prepared, just trust yourself to use what you’ve practiced. Meditation, listening to music, exercise, whatever you need to do to keep a level head.
        </p>
        <h2>Day Before an Interview</h2>
        <p>
            Lay out your outfit. It should be business attire, which means slacks or skirt, button down shirt, and possibly a blazer. Definitely wear a belt and nice shoes.. Print out 5 copies of your resume and bring them in a folder with some paper to take any notes you may need. Map yourself to the interview site and know how traffic will affect your timing. Take time to relax, don’t think about big O notation any more, and go to sleep early.
        </p>
        <h2>During the Interview</h2>
        <p>
            Use your STAR scenarios you came up with and follow the 7 steps for technical questions. Be sure to listen and follow up with the questions you brainstormed while researching the company. Make eye contact, smile, and remember your interviewer’s name.
