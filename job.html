        <h1>Impressing on the Job</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The first three months of a job (or the duration of an internship) are basically one big interview. You need to prove that you have the skills to succeed in this particular workplace. This guide is designed for experiences that have one project for you to work on over the course of the summer. Throughout these weeks, meet with your mentor. Check in about expectations they have for you and if you’re meeting those expectations. Make sure to keep track of exactly what you do so you’re prepared for any final presentations and self evaluations. Don’t oversell your skills or promise things you can’t do. Under promise and over deliver.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 1 - Foundation</h2>
        <p>
            Meet your mentor, go through orientation, and understand the scope of your work. Start learning the tools you’ll need to get the job done.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 2 - Ramp up</h2>
        <p>
            Continue to ramp up on technologies, then begin to dig into your project. Don’t start work yet. Break it down into 5 phases. The endpoint of each phase should be a deliverable that works by itself, so if you don’t finish the next phase, you have a final project to show.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 3 - First taste</h2>
        <p>
            Begin work on your first phase. Things won’t go exactly to plan. Meet with your mentor and any other customers involved in the project.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 4 - First phase done</h2>
        <p>
            Finish your first phase, then debug and write tests. Make sure your code is commented! Possibly demo for your mentor.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 5 - Evaluate and modify plan</h2>
        <p>
            Look back at how quickly you were able to finish the first phase, then adjust your schedule based on that. Begin work on the second phase.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 6 - Second phase done</h2>
        <p>
            Finish the second phase, debug, test, comment.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 7 - Buffer work week</h2>
        <p>
            Use this week to catch up if you’re behind or get ahead if you’re not. Also if there are any intern events, take time to go to them!
        </p>
        <h2>Week 8 - Third phase done</h2>
        <p>
            Finish the third phase, debug, test, comment. Demo to mentor.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 9 - Fourth phase done</h2>
        <p>
            Finish the fourth phase, debug, test, comment. Demo to mentor.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 10 - Fifth phase done</h2>
        <p>
            Finish the fifth phase, debug, test, comment. Demo to mentor.
        </p>
        <h2>Week 11 - Documentation and debug</h2>
        <p>
            Run tests and submit them with your code. Make sure everything works together and write up some official documentation for your project. Begin your final presentation (if you have one).
        </p>
        <h2>Week 12 - Final wrap up</h2>
        <p>
            Practice your final presentation, begin job applications for next year, finish up offboarding stuff. You’re done!
